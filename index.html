          <h4>Puzzel #1</h4>
          <p>I have more than two animals at home. All of them are dogs,except for two. All of
            them are cats, except for two. All of them are hamsters, except for two.
            <br/>
            What kinds of animals and how many of each do I have?</p>

          <h4>Puzzel #2</h4>
          <p>Farmer Brown and Farmer Green were ruminating one day on the fence between their
             farms. Farmer Brown says, "You know I was just thinking. If you gave me one of your
             cows, then we would have the same number of cows." Farmer Green replies, "If you
             gave me one of your cows, then I would have twice as many as you!"
             <br/>
             How many cows does Farmer Brown have and how many cows does Farmer Green have?</p>

          <h4>Puzzel #3</h4>
          <p>An intelligent trader travels from 1 place to another carrying 3 sacks having 30 coconuts
            each.No sack can hold more than 30 coconuts. On the way he passes through 30 checkpoints
            and on each checkpoint he has to give 1 coconut for each sack of coconuts he is carrying.
            <br/>
            How many coconuts are left in the end?<br/> &nbsp </p>

        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <h4>Puzzel #4</h4>
          <p>A milkman has an 8-liter container full of milk, and also two empty containers that measure 5
            liters and 3 liters. He needs to deliver 4 liters of milk to a customer. The milkman has no other
            spare containers and no way to mark any containers. He does not want to pour milk away.
            <br/>
            How will he measure the 4 liters of milk?</p>

          <h4>Puzzel #5</h4>
          <p>A farmer was asked how many ducks he had. "Well," he said, "they ran down the path just now and I
            saw one duck in front of two ducks, a duck behind two ducks, and a duck between two ducks."
            <br/>
            How many ducks were there?</p>

          <h4>Puzzel #6</h4>
          <P>What weighs more - a pound of iron or a pound of feathers?</p>
